# number-plate-detection
An advanced, real-time number plate detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv10. It detects license plates and classifies alphanumeric characters (A–Z, 0–9) in video streams and images. The model is trained on a custom dataset in YOLO format for fast and accurate results, optimized for both performance and clarity.
